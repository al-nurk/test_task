## About test_task

This is a repo for a QA engineer who is not afraid to touch git. Implementing tests correctly is not mandatory. We want to check if person is not afraid to work with git and can follow simple instructions at the beginning. Like clone/fork the repo, install node js and run tests as is, to see what is happening. However, noone stops you to try it out and see if you actually can work with code ))

## Getting Started

Hi there,
under testcafe you will find a file called test.spec.js. This file contains one almost completed test that you need to correct and six more tests that you need to write yourself.
In this exmaple we are using a Javascript framework called Testcafe. 
Feel free to use Testcafes documentation [https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/reference/] .

We are testing a webshop [https://www.saucedemo.com/]. 
On the login page you will find credentials that you need to use to complete all tests.
Good luck!
