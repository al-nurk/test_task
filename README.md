## Getting Started

Hi there,
under testcafe you will find a file called test.spec.js. This file contains one almost complete test that you need to correct and six more tests that you need to write yourself.
In this exmaple we are using a Javascript framework called Testcafe. 
Feel free to use Testcafes documentation [https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/reference/] .

We are testing a webshop [https://www.saucedemo.com/]. 
On the login page you find credentials that you need to use to complete all tests.
Good luck!
